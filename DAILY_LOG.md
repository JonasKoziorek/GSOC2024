# Daily Log

In this document I will be writing down what I worked on during the specific days.

# 6.6.2024

## Goals for today
1. Set up a personal blog where I will track my progress. ✅︎
2. Write a post to Julia discourse about my GSOC. ❌
3. Start reading and implementing the CD algorithm. ❌
4. Read about numerical bifurcation analysis before meeting with Romain Veltz next week. ✅︎

## Today's activity
* I set up some simple blank blog via github pages.
* I am reading `Practical Bifurcation and Stability Analysis` from `Seydel`. I studied:

    * classification of equilibrium points (nodes, saddles, foci)
    * linearization near equilibrium points via taylor
    * analysis of eigvals of jacobian at equilibrium points
    * nullclines
    * perturbations

## Work hours
