= Problems & Questions

- would it be possible to allow `step!(ds, t)` for `t<0`? https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl/issues/538

- dispatch on constructor together with `@kwdef`? How to differentiate between two versions of parameters.

- Breaking changes to the previous api?

- Saiki seems like a bad algorithm - I wasn't able to detect any UPO in lorentz system, only FPs.

- Automatic diff of `step!(ds, n)`?

== What is missing

- porting documentation and tests
- checking performance and allocations
