= Extracting unstable periodic orbits from chaotic time series data

== Input & Output
Should be the same as in the previous paper (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.4705)

== Overview
- A method to extract unstable periodic orbits from chaotic timeseries is proposed.
- Timeseries data transformation is conducted so that transformed data are concentrated on the periodic orbit.
- Noisy data can be used.
- Works for #text(weight: "bold")[Discrete dynamical systems].
- This paper is a follow-up to the work https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.4705. Previous paper focused on the 1-periodic orbit (fixed point) extraction of discrete systems. This paper provides more examples and deep theoretical explanation.
- This paper is very long and very mathematical (hard). However the previous paper is very easy to understand.

== Notes
They mention that ergodic properties such as dimension, Lyapunov exponents, and topological entropy can be determined from periodic orbits.
Moreover, detection of periodic orbits from data is a test for presence of determinism.
Finding periodic orbits has application for control of chaos.
